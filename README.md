## Hi reader!

I'm Michael, a software engineer who recently moved to BC, Canada! I'm very comfortable across reproducible analysis, server, and web technologies, and have experience with Python, Typescript (incl. React), Swift and C#.

Some fun things about me:

- 🏃‍➡️ I’m an avid runner and enjoy finding new places to run! I’ve run a mixture of marathon and ultramarathon events.
- ✈️ I recently earned my private pilot's license, by flying a mixture of cross-country, and controlled airspaces. Although tough, i enjoyed learning about aerodynamics, meteorology, and air law.
- 📷 I love taking photos when outdoors, here's my [flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/illusionalp/).
